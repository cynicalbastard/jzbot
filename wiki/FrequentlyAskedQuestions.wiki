This document contains some commonly-asked questions about JZBot and answers for those questions. There are a couple of things to remember when reading this page:
 * JZBot's factoid language is called *Fact*, and is referred to by that name within this page.
 * A *pm*, when used on this page, refers to a message sent directly to the bot instead of at a channel. Some people also know this as *querying*. Most IRC clients let you send these with "/msg <person> <message...>", where <person> is the person to send to and <message> is the message to send.

==Is there a way to get the pid of a bot by messaging it?==
There is. Send `exec {{mbean||java.lang:type=Runtime||Name}}` to your bot in a pm, and it will respond with `pid@host`, where pid is the process id. You must be a superop to do this.

==Where did the name "JZBot" come from?==
The JZBot project was started by javawizard (see JZBot's home page for a list of project members). Javawizard had attained the nickname "javawiz" on IRC before he switched nicknames to jcp. The "JZ" in JZBot's name comes from "JavawiZ". The "Bot" part should be obvious.

==How fast is JZBot's Fact interpreter?==
First off, Fact was not designed to be fast; it was designed to be concise and easy-to-use. That said, JZBot's Fact interpreter is not the slowest thing around. Below are some benchmarks that were run on a Sony Vaio VGN-FZ298CE with a 1.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and 3GB of RAM (of which JZBot used about 4MB). Each benchmark is given as a Fact program, a short explanation of what it does, and the average execution time over 5 runs. This can also be used as a general reference to which functions perform the fastest.
