JZBot is primarily an IRC bot. However, it can also connect to servers using these protocols:

 * IRC (obviously)
 * [http://bzflag.org BZFlag]
 * XMPP (!GoogleTalk and GMail)

We're working to add support for these protocols in the future:

 * XMPP/Jabber/Google Talk
 * MSN/Windows Live Messenger
 * Facebook
 * AOL Instant Messenger (also known as AIM)

If you have a particular protocol you'd like to see support for, join our [ChatRoom chat room] and tell us about it.
