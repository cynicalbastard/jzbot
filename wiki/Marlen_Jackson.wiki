Marlen_Jackson is the official JZBot. He (yes, it's a "he") connects to irc.iukkoth.net and irc.freenode.net (two separate installations, both run by the same person). irc.iukkoth.net is considered the official server. Join #jzbot there and send "~help", and he'll respond to you. Or try "~roulette".

If you'd like to chat with Marlen_Jackson over the internet, go [http://widget2.mibbit.com/?autoConnect=true&channel=%23jzbot&server=irc.iukkoth.net here]. When it asks, type a nickname you'd like to use, then click *connect*. This will get you connected to irc.iukkoth.net and joined to #jzbot.
