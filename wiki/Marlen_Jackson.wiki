Marlen_Jackson is the official JZBot. He (yes, it's a "he") connects to irc.iukkoth.net and irc.freenode.net (two separate installations, both run by the same person). irc.iukkoth.net is considered the official server. Join <a href="irc://irc.iukkoth.net/#jzbot"> #jzbot</a> there and send "~help", and he'll respond to you. Or try "~roulette".
