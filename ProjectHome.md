<b>JZBot</b> (sometimes known as <b>Marlen Jackson</b> or <b>multimarlen</b>) is an IRC bot written by <a href='People.md'>a bunch of random people</a>. But it's a lot more than just your average IRC bot. It can connect to some <a href='Protocols.md'>other protocols</a> besides just IRC, and it has a built-in scripting language called Fact that allows it to do just about anything. And programs are generally so concise, you can program it simply by sending a program in a chat message. Here's some things that can be done with scripts (and therefore, JZBot in general):<br>
<ul><li>Public channel logging<br>
</li><li>Game of Werewolf, otherwise known as Mafia or Murder in the Dark<br>
</li><li>Adding news items to a channel topic, and rotating out old ones when the topic is too large to fit them<br>
</li><li>Keeping track of users' popularity with a karma system<br>
</li><li>Reading RSS feeds and sending messages to the channel when there's more news<br>
</li><li>Kicking/Banning users that use profanity<br>
</li><li>Reminders (IE having JZBot remind you to do a specific task at a specific time)<br>
<b>Want to chat with JZBot?</b> There are a couple of ways of doing it:<br>
</li><li>Join our <b><a href='ChatRoom.md'>chat room</a></b>. This is where we (the developers) hang out in person, so you can ask us for help.<br>
</li><li>If you have <b>GMail</b>, add multimarlen@opengroove.org to your contacts list, then send him an invite to chat (with the "Invite to Chat" button next to him in your contact list). If he's online, he'll accept your chat invitation and you can start chatting. If he's not, he'll accept the next time he comes online. Then, open up a chat with him and send <b>lart</b> or <b>help</b> to him.<br>
</li><li>If you have a <b>Facebook</b> account, add Marlen as a friend! You can view his Facebook profile and add him as a friend <a href='http://facebook.com/marlenjackson'>here</a>.<br>
