JZBot is primarily an IRC bot. However, it can also connect to servers using these protocols:

  * IRC (obviously)
  * [BZFlag](http://bzflag.org)
  * XMPP (GoogleTalk, GMail, and Jabber)
  * [Facebook](http://facebook.com/marlenjackson)
  * Email (which also means Text Messaging on most cell phone providers, AT&T and Verizon included)

We're working to add support for these protocols in the future:

  * MSN/Windows Live Messenger
  * AOL Instant Messenger (also known as AIM)
  * Skype

If you have a particular protocol you'd like to see support for, join our [chat room](ChatRoom.md) and tell us about it.
